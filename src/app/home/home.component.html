        <h3>What is Hire Purchase</h3>
        Hire purchase is a way to finance buying a new or used car. You (usually) pay a deposit and pay off the value of the car
        in monthly instalments, with the loan secured against the car. This means you don't own the vehicle until the last
        payment is made.
